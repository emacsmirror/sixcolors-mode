# Six Colors Mode - for Emacs users that bleed in six colors

This software is a homage to the old six colors Apple logo and to what that culture has meant for the community.

It draws a rainbow on the modeline according to the position of the point, so to have a horizontal scrollbar that shows you where the point is relatively to the size of the current buffer.

It's basically a fork of [TeMPOraL Nyan-mode](https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode) but without the cat, the animations and the music. 
The rainbow is based on the colors of the six colors rainbow logo that Apple used between 1977 and 1998.

And if you don't like the six-colors Apple logo, you can easily customizing the appearance by using the `sixcolors-colors` variable by using the standard `M-x configure` command under emacs or by manually set it to a list of colors (up to six obviously).

Some example, for italians users like me:

for the americans ones:

and if you are a nostalgic spectrum user:

In the next days I will try to release it on MELPA and it will be part of the standard distribution of Six Colors Emacs, a new configuration framework for Emacs I am currently working on and that will be based on a vintage look and curated configuration.
